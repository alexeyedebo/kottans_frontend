    Build a bunch of test projects
    Have fun together

    Git, Github
    HTML, CSS
    JavaScript

General requirements

    English knowledge, most of the materials will be in English.

    You will make a repository on GitHub and save your progress in it. More on repositories in task 0 (see below).

    Styling: it's up to you, but remember to make it readable. Using markdown is a good idea.

    Reading: for each article you are required to read please post the answers to the following questions in your respective repo. Don't worry, your answers will not be graded. It's just a way to reflect on what you have learned.

    name (at least) one thing that was new to you
    name (at least) one thing that surprised you
    name (at least) one thing you will use in the future

    Online courses: finish all tasks, add some reflection about them in README.

    Videos: same as for reading - watch the video, answer three questions.

Task 0 (get familiar with Git and Github):

    Finish the course How to use Git and Github

    Finish try.github.io

    Create repository named "kottans_frontend".

    Create README.md for the repository.

    Describe your impressions about learned materials.

    Send a pull-request to repo Kottans/mock-repo proposing a change. It could be anything, really. If you have found a typo in README - great! Take care to give your PR a meaningful name and description. Please note, that your PR may not be reviewed quickly.

When you finish this task you can start the next one:

Test 1
P.S. If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that you’ll spend a lot of time building something big together - a new way of learning and collaborating. You’ll become part of a small family and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this friendship, as in any friendship should be. Final part of this course will be to split a parts and create news courses like that (and we’ll never stop).
